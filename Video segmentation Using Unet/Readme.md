The Best Example of transfer learning

I have trained my UNET Model on PET images dataset,
Unet Model Consists Of 
 Two parts
 - Decoder 
 Decoder Consist of Convolution layers 
 - Encoder
 Eecoder Consist of Transposed Convolution layers 
 
- ![](https://github.com/DASHANANT/Video-segmentation-using-Unet/blob/main/Unet%20Architecture%20.jpg)

- Can it classify Human Beings?
- Yes it does.

Output of segmentation was nearly 90% Accurate
Try to run.
